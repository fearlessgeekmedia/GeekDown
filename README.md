# GeekDown

<br />

![1.00](blob:file:///877ae2bf-e12f-4b1f-8693-d90346499ebb)

GeekDown is a desktop markdown editor I created using Milkdown, Crepe, W3.css, and Electron.&#x20;

<br />

I wanted to get a little more experience with Milkdown before adding it to FearlessCMS.&#x20;

<br />

Right now, I only have this working in Linux - MX Linux specifically. I have run it in MacOS yet, and I don't have Windows. This is alpha software at this time.

<br />

If you download the source, do the following.

<br />

**Linux**

```
npm install electron electron-builder vite --save-dev
```

To test

```
npm run electron:dev
```

To build

```
npm run electron:build
```

An AppImage will be in the electron-dist directory. Enjoy!
